## üîÑ Automated Processing Pipeline

### Basic Flow (Implemented)

> Triggered on the 1st of every month by CloudWatch. Dispatcher Lambda splits the data and invokes multiple Executor Lambdas to handle user statistics calculation concurrently.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    MonthlyCloudWatch --> DispatcherLambda
    DispatcherLambda -->|Invoke with range| ExecutorLambda1
    DispatcherLambda -->|Invoke with range| ExecutorLambda2
    ExecutorLambda1 --> MongoDB
    ExecutorLambda2 --> MongoDB
    ExecutorLambda1 --> DispatcherLambda
    ExecutorLambda2 --> DispatcherLambda
    DispatcherLambda --> SNS --> DiscordLambda --> DiscordWebhook
```

#### Dispatcher Breakdown

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Total Records: 10,000] --> B{Split into chunks of 2,000}
  B --> C1[Chunk 0: 0-1999]
  B --> C2[Chunk 1: 2000-3999]
  B --> C3[Chunk 2: 4000-5999]
  B --> C4[Chunk 3: 6000-7999]
  B --> C5[Chunk 4: 8000-9999]

  subgraph Batch 1
    C1 --> L1[Executor 1]
    C2 --> L2[Executor 2]
    C3 --> L3[Executor 3]
    C4 --> L4[Executor 4]
    C5 --> L5[Executor 5]
  end

  L1 --> R[Dispatcher collects result]
  L2 --> R
  L3 --> R
  L4 --> R
  L5 --> R
  R --> SNS1[SNS Notification]
  SNS1 --> D1[Discord Lambda]
```

#### Executor Logic

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Executor receives 2,000 records] --> B{Split into batches of 1,000}
  B --> C1[Batch 0: 0‚Äì999]
  B --> C2[Batch 1: 1000‚Äì1999]
  C1 -->|Concurrency 15| MongoDB
  C2 -->|Concurrency 15| MongoDB
```

#### Limitations of Basic Flow

- All data is processed in a single window, which may risk AWS Lambda timeout (15 minutes)
- Poor scalability for 100,000+ records or rapid growth
- Static monthly scheduling without staging

---

### Extended Scalable Flow (Conceptual ‚Äì Not Yet Implemented)

> Designed for large-scale data sets. Uses a Scheduler Lambda at the beginning of the month to create a dynamic CloudWatch event rule to trigger processing stages at regular intervals.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    MonthlyCloudWatch --> SchedulerLambda
    SchedulerLambda --> CloudWatchStageRule
    CloudWatchStageRule --> HourlyStageProcessor
    HourlyStageProcessor --> DispatcherLambda
    DispatcherLambda --> ExecutorLambdas
    ExecutorLambdas --> MongoDB
    ExecutorLambdas --> DispatcherLambda
    DispatcherLambda --> SNS --> DiscordLambda --> DiscordWebhook
```

- **Scheduler Lambda**: Calculates total records and determines how many stages are required. Sets up dynamic CloudWatch rules.
- **CloudWatchStageRule**: Triggers HourlyStageProcessor at fixed intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes)
- **HourlyStageProcessor**: Determines current stage and invokes Dispatcher for the corresponding data chunk
- **Dispatcher & Executor**: Same logic as in Basic Flow, but only for that stage
- **SNS + Discord**: Sends per-stage summaries after all Executors complete

### Key Differences: Basic vs. Extended Flow

| Aspect               | Basic Flow (Implemented)        | Extended Flow (Conceptual)                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger Source       | Monthly CloudWatch              | Monthly CloudWatch ‚Üí Dynamic interval rule         |
| Dispatcher Logic     | Processes all users immediately | Processes **one stage** (e.g. 10,000) per interval |
| Interval Control     | Static schedule (monthly)       | Configurable (e.g. every 10m, hourly...)           |
| Stage Initialization | N/A                             | Scheduler Lambda creates processing stages         |
| Progress Tracking    | N/A                             | MongoDB `processing_state` per stage               |
| Lambda Invocation    | All at once                     | Spread across intervals and stages                 |
| Notification         | Once per full run               | Once per stage (via SNS ‚Üí Discord)                 |
| Use Case             | Small to medium datasets        | Large datasets (100k+ users)                       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current System Configuration

| Component             | Value                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| CloudWatch Frequency  | Monthly (Basic), Custom (Extended) |
| Dispatcher Chunk Size | 2000 records                       |
| Executor Batch Size   | 1000 users                         |
| Internal Batch Size   | 100 playbacks                      |
| Max Concurrency       | 15 concurrent operations           |
| Max Lambda Runtime    | 15 minutes (AWS limit)             |
